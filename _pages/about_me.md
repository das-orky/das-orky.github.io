# The North Star


<hr>
It is said that in ancient Greek they only asked one question after a man died:

 **"Did he have passion? "**
 
The profundity of this notion is such that a lack of purpose or passion in one's life can render it desolate. Passion can manifest in various forms, be it aspiring to excel as an athlete, writer, scientist, or dedicating oneself to the betterment of one's own family or other noble causes. It is crucial to embody this passion, and for me, it resides in expanding the boundaries of my knowledge within the realms of computer science and genomic analysis.

This journey began many years ago, with my love for A.I. (before 2012 deep network revolution). If I have to put my journey into a series of events it will be as follows:
1. Anthropomorphizing intelligence: my initial understanding of comprehending AI necessitated a grasp of the intricacies of the human brain. Consequently, I embarked upon an extensive study of literature, including books like "Principles of Neural Science", "On Intelligence", "In Search of Memory", etc. Although these texts provided valuable theoretical foundations, I recognized the need for a mathematical model that could be translated into practical code. The question still remains in me whether intelligence only resides in the neocortex or does limbic system plays any role in intelligence. 
2. Subsequently, I directed my focus towards contemplating the nature of input received by the human brain, which can be understood as a diverse array of signals. This brought to mind a profound statement by Nikola Tesla, who once remarked, **"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration."** I delved into exploring the frequency domain, employing tools such as Fourier and wavelet transforms to gain insights into signal analysis and processing.
3. I embarked on a study of wavelet transform, ultimately leveraging its potential in my doctoral research to classify different subtypes of lung cancer in histopathology images of the human lung. Moreover, wavelet transform proved instrumental in the classification of diverse lung texture types observed in Computed Tomography (CT) images. Concurrently, I found myself increasingly drawn towards the field of life sciences, owing to the prevalent research environment within my doctoral institution, which predominantly focuses on life science disciplines.
4. The advent of deep neural networks has revolutionized the landscape of machine learning, rendering many traditional approaches obsolete. Embracing the wisdom of Darwin, who advocated for adaptability to change, I too recognized the need to adapt. Consequently, I transitioned away from anthropomorphizing intelligence (though a lingering fascination persists) and instead began contemplating the realms of N-dimensional matrix spaces and the intricate embedding of information within this domain.
5. As my fascination with biology deepened, I started reading "Biological Science" authored by Freeman.  After understanding the cell, its structure and its working, my view for the field changed. I started contemplating the integration of A.I methodologies to address challenges in life sciences, with focus on DNA analysis.
6. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of DNA analysis entails delving into the intricate pipelines of tools and software utilized to extract valuable insights from DNA sequences. The specific tools employed in this process vary depending on the experimental context and the desired information sought. I started exploring the bioinformatics domain to get a deeper understanding of these tools in terms of the problem at hand.

Thus, the passion or north star for me is the A.I., but A.I. needs to be applied to some field, for me the field is genomics.
